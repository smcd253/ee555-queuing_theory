# It is desired to design an Erlang C calculator for the M/M/c "delayed calls queuing
# model" that we discussed on Friday session. The input parameters are the average
# arrival rate () in packets/min, the average service rate () in packets/min. In addition,
# you are given the following two “input constraints”:
# a. The probability that an arriving Packet will find all servers busy (i.e. P (W > 0))
# should not exceed  where  is an input parameter.
# b. Given that an arriving packet must wait, the average waiting time should not exceed
#  minutes where  is an input parameter. Hint: This is conditional expectations.
# Review_cond EE503)
# The outputs of your calculator should be the number of servers required to satisfy
# the above requirements/constraints. In addition, your calculator should enable me to
# find the following averages: The average number of busy servers and the average
# number of packets in the system (both waiting and being served
